# Netlify Functions Setup Guide

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Your app has been successfully migrated from Supabase Edge Functions to **Netlify Functions**!

### 🎯 **Current Architecture:**

- **Frontend**: React app hosted on Netlify
- **Backend**: Supabase (database only)
- **AI Functions**: Netlify Functions (serverless)

### 🚀 **What's Been Created:**

**Netlify Functions:**

- `/api/analyze-topic` - AI-powered topic analysis and refinement suggestions
- `/api/analyze-chapter` - Detailed chapter relevance analysis with AI insights
- `/api/generate-embeddings` - Vector embeddings for semantic search

**Configuration:**

- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build and function configuration
- Function redirects: `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/*`

### ⚙️ **Required: Set OpenAI API Key**

To enable AI features, add your OpenAI API key to Netlify:

#### Method 1: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add a variable**
5. Set:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)
6. Click **Save**
7. **Redeploy** your site

#### Method 2: Netlify CLI

```bash
# Set environment variable
netlify env:set OPENAI_API_KEY your_openai_api_key_here

# Redeploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 🧪 **Testing Functions**

Once deployed, your functions will be available at:

- `https://yoursite.netlify.app/api/analyze-topic`
- `https://yoursite.netlify.app/api/analyze-chapter`
- `https://yoursite.netlify.app/api/generate-embeddings`

### 🔍 **Verification**

After setting the API key and redeploying:

1. ✅ Status component shows "Netlify Functions: Connected"
2. ✅ Logs show successful function calls
3. ✅ AI analysis works with real OpenAI responses

### 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

- **✅ API Key Security**: OpenAI key is server-side only
- **✅ Automatic Scaling**: Netlify handles function scaling
- **✅ Global CDN**: Functions run close to users
- **✅ Integrated Monitoring**: Built-in Netlify function logs

### 📊 **Performance**

Expected benefits:

- **Faster**: No client-side OpenAI calls
- **Secure**: API keys hidden from browser
- **Scalable**: Automatic function scaling
- **Reliable**: Built-in error handling and fallbacks

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

#### Functions Not Working

- Check Netlify function logs in dashboard
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Ensure site has been redeployed after setting env vars

#### API Key Issues

- Key must start with `sk-`
- Check OpenAI account credits
- Verify key has correct permissions

#### Local Development

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Run locally with functions
netlify dev
```

### 🎉 **Your Setup is Complete!**

- ✅ Netlify Functions deployed
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions removed
- ✅ Architecture optimized for Netlify + Supabase
- ✅ Ready for production

Just set your OpenAI API key and your AI-powered app will be fully functional!
