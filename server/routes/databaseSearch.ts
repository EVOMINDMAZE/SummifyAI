Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. When the weather is good, they feel good. When it isn't, it affects their attitude and performance. Proactive people carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn't a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.

Look at each position they take and ask yourself 'Why?' Why do they take this position? What are their underlying concerns?

Generate options that advance shared interests and creatively reconcile differing interests. Look for mutual gains. Ask what if questions. Change the scope of the agreement. Look for trades across party lines. You can satisfy differing interests when those interests dovetail - like a buyer who wants prompt delivery and a seller who wants prompt payment. Shared interests lie latent in every negotiation. They may not be immediately obvious. Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa.

By discussing such criteria rather than what the parties are willing or unwilling to do, neither party need give in to the other; both can defer to a fair solution. The more you bring standards of fairness, efficiency, or scientific merit to bear on your particular problem, the more likely you are to produce a final package that is wise and fair.

These three elements, completely ignored by the if-then rewards system, are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses, our lives, our world.

The good news is that the ingredients of autonomous motivation are already present in most workplaces. The bad news is that many businesses haven't recognized this fact and still operate under assumptions of Theory X. True autonomous motivation involves four essential aspects: autonomy over task, time, technique, and team. Autonomy over task means having discretion over what you do. Autonomy over time means having flexibility over when you do it. Autonomy over technique means having control over how you do it. And autonomy over team means having a say over whom you do it with.

And mastery is an asymptote: It's impossible to fully realize, which makes it simultaneously frustrating and alluring.
