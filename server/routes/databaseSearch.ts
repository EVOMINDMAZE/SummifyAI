        text: "Being proactive means taking responsibility for your life. You can't keep blaming everything on your parents or grandparents. Proactive people recognize that they are 'response-able.' They don't blame genetics, circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. They know they choose their behavior. Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. When the weather is good, they feel good. When it isn't, it affects their attitude and performance.",

        text: "Begin with the End in Mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you're going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction. It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it's leaning against the wrong wall.",

        text: "Negotiators are people first. Every negotiator has two kinds of interests: in the substance and in the relationship. And the relationship tends to become entangled with the problem. The basic approach to dealing with people problems is to separate the people from the problem. This allows you to deal directly and empathetically with the person, while addressing the problem with minimal emotional interference. Attack the problem, not the person.",

        title: "Focus on Interests, Not Positions",
        text: "Your position is something you have decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide. For a wise solution reconcile interests, not positions. Behind opposed positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones. Identifying interests is not always easy. People tend to state their conclusions - their positions - rather than describe their underlying concerns.",

        title: "Generate Options for Mutual Gain",
        text: "The third element of the method is to generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do. This is the creative step in the process where you broaden your options rather than look for a single answer. Generate options that advance shared interests and creatively reconcile differing interests. Look for mutual gains. Ask what if questions. Change the scope of the agreement. Look for trades across party lines.",

The three elements of true motivation are: Autonomy - the desire to direct our own lives; Mastery - the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and Purpose - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.",

The good news is that the ingredients of autonomous motivation are already present in most workplaces. The bad news is that many businesses haven't recognized this fact and still operate under assumptions of Theory X. True autonomous motivation involves four essential aspects: autonomy over task, time, technique, and team.",
